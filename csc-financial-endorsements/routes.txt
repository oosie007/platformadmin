# CSC Financial Endorsements – Routes

Base app: customer-service. Base path typically /customer-service (or similar).

## Routes

1. :region/policy/:id
   - Component/Page: Product details (policy view/edit).
   - Purpose: User views policy and makes changes (insureds, objects, coverages, etc.). Changes are accumulated in endorsement state. "Review Changes" navigates to summary.

2. :region/policy/:id/summary
   - Component/Page: Summary (Review Changes).
   - Purpose: Shows endorsement preview (from API isPreview=true), list of changes, and the form (endorsement reason, correspondence, notes). On Save, calls API with isPreview=false and form values, then navigates back on success.

## Example URLs

- /customer-service/us/policy/XBUCHCA00017371
- /customer-service/us/policy/XBUCHCA00017371/summary

## Guards

In Canvas, both routes use expiryGuard (canActivate). Replicate or skip in the new project as needed.
